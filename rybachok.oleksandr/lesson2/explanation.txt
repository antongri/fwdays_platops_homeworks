1. The reconiliation loop works by taking the update time interval and:
- checking if controlled resource exsists (create if not)
- checking the changes in given Custom Resource (ConfigSync)
- apply changes according to input CR if there are differences between target and CR
- remove target if CR is deleted

2. The error conditions could be handled by checking the logs of the controller/operator pod. Usually this is due to lack of permissions or issues with the kubernetes.

3. No major issues were faced. My first try was without the changes for the role, I forgot to add access to the configmap resource. Found that issue in controller pod logs, added relevant string to the controller go code.
